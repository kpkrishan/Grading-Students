1. Take n grading numbers
2. Take input line by line using an empty list and iterating thru n number of inputs
3. Iterating through list :
	check whether the grade is less than 38 or not
	if less than 38 print the same grade
	else check for grade >= 38
		# Here our problem is divided into two parts on the basis of round variable

			round=((grade//10)*10)+5

		if grade <round:
			check the difference of grade and round for less than 3.
			if <3
			 make grade= round as per question
			else :
			no rounding off in the grade.
		else:
			now check the difference for grade and round+5 for less than 3.
			
			if difference <3
				grade=round+5
				
			else:
				no rounding off the grade to nearest 5.
